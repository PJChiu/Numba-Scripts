    "NumPy is a very popular Python library for efficiently working with large amounts of numerical data.  Even if you haven't used NumPy directly, many popular libraries depend on NumPy, such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and statsmodels.  Learning to use NumPy is *the most important thing you can do to speed up your numerical applications*.  Those skills will transfer to the GPU, whether you use CuPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX or some other GPU-accelerated array library.\n",

    "\n",
    " * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n",
    " * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    " * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application\n",
    " * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays.\n",

    "### Requirements\n",

    "and Python versions:\n",

    " * Python 3.6-3.8 *(If you need Python 2, Numba 0.47 is the last release)*\n",
    " * NumPy 1.15 and later\n",
    "\n",
    "and a very wide range of hardware:\n",

    "* x86, x86_64/AMD64 CPUs\n",
    "* NVIDIA CUDA GPUs (Compute capability 3.0 and later, CUDA 8.0 and later)\n",
